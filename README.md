**Abstract:**   
1\. The electrical activity of Cardiac Purkinje fibres was reconstructed using
a mathematical model of the membrane current. The individual components of
ionic curent were described by equations which wee based as closely as
possible on previous experiments using the voltage clamp technique. 2.
Membrane action potentials and pace-maker activity were calculated and
compared with time course of underlying changes in two functionally distinct
outeard currents, iX1 and iK2. 3. The repolarization of the theoretical action
potential is triggered by the onset of iX1, which becomes activated over the
plateau range of potentials. iK2 also activates during the plateau but does
not play a controlling role in the repolarization. Hwever, iK2 does govern the
slow pace-maker depolarization through its subsequent deactivation at negative
potentials. 4. The individual phases of the calculated action potential and
their 'experimental' modifications were compared with published records. The
upstroke is generated by a Hodgkin-Huxley type sodium conductance (gNa), and
rises with a maximum rate of 478 V/sec, somewhat less than experimentally
observed values ( up to 800 V/sec). The discrepancy is discussed in relation
to experimental attempts at measuring gNa. 5. The ole of the transient outward
chloride current (called igr) was studied in calculations of the rapid phase
of repolarization and 'notch' configuration...
